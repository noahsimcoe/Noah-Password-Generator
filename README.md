# Noah's Password Generator
Challenge 03 - JavaScript

## Description
I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript functionality. I proved that I knew how to use JavaScript's built-in confirm/prompt functions, as well as create my own functions from scratch. I also demonstrated my ability to use conditional statements to organize/make decisions based upon the user-gathered feedback from my application.

When building this project I also learned how open the "JavaScript world" is, and how there are many ways to find solutions in your code. Thus, I realized that there are sometimes ways to make the same exact code with a lot fewer lines, which is an important thing to keep in mind because it can save a lot of time/energy with creating an application.

## Installation
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages and available to view.

## Usage
This project is used to generate a completely random password based off the user's input answers. The user can select the length of their desired password and the types of characters that their password will contain.
